### Installation
The programming language, Ruby, can be installed on any operating system (Windows, Mac, Unix/Linux). All installation options are available from https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/. Once you have reached the website there is a place on the page that says, “see installation page”. That link will bring you to another page that has a list of platforms from which your operating system can use.  

Like the programming language Perl, Ruby by default is installed on Mac and Linux computers.  To check if your computer already has Ruby, open up the terminal and type: 
```
Ruby -v
```
If Ruby is installed it will tell you the version, if not an error message will appear. 

Since Windows does not come with Ruby preinstalled you can either go to https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ or http://rubyinstaller.org for installation.

###Creating and Running Ruby
Ruby can be written using an IDE(Integrated Development Environment) such as RubyMine https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/ or Aptana Studio http://www.aptana.com but using a text editor is prefered by most programmers who program in Ruby. There are a lot of text editors out there, consider picking one with syntax higlighting to make coding easier. Also, you should note, by using a text editor your program will run from the command line (terminal). In order to call your program you should use the name of your program your_program_name.rb and this is what it would look like written in the terminal:

```
ruby your_program_name.rb
```


### Writing in Ruby
If you have used other languages such as Python and Perl you’ll be familiar with putting print before a statement you would like to be printed. Well in the case of Ruby its version of print in put. For example:

```
put “Hello World”
```

As you can see there is no semicolon (;) after the statement. This is because Ruby does not require any semicolons unless there is more than one statement on a single line.

###Commenting
To comment in Ruby a # is used, like this;
```
#comment
```
