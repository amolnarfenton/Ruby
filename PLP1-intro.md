### Intro to Ruby
The name of the language I chose is Ruby. The language Ruby was created in the mid 1900s by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan. The first version 
was released on the web in 1993. Since the initial release several versions have come out. the latest one was December of 2015. Matsumoto 
used other languages, such as Perl, Smalltalk and Lisp, as a starting for Ruby. There was no particular problem that sparked the development 
of Ruby. It is said that Matsumoto did not really like working with Perl or Python and wanted an alternative that combined a scripting 
language with an object-oriented aspect of programming. This being said Ruby is a dynamic, reflective object-oriented programming language. 
Ruby incorperates multiple programming paradigms such as functional, object-oriented and imperative. Ruby is a both a compiled and 
interprered language. It does not come with a virtual machine but a developer by the name of Koichi Sasada created a Yet Another Virtual Machine (YARV)
with the purpose of reducing the processing time. Ruby is most commonly ued in conjunction with Rails which is known as Ruby on Rails. Ruby on Rails is 
a programming language developed for creating web applications.
