### Intro to Ruby

Ruby is a high- level language that incorperates multiple programming paradigms such as functional, object-oriented and imperative. Since it is both a compiled and interprered language Ruby allows the code to be compiled and then interpreted by the virtual machine. I'm not sure if Ruby needs a virtual machine but a developer by the name of Koichi Sasada did created Yet Another Virtual Machine (YARV) with the purpose of reducing the processing time.

### History

Ruby was created in the mid 1900s by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan. The first version 
was released on the web in 1993. Since the initial release several versions have come out. The latest one was December of 2015. 
Matsumoto used other languages, such as Perl, Smalltalk and Lisp, as a starting for Ruby. There was no particular problem that sparked the development of Ruby. It is said that Matsumoto did not really like working with Perl or Python and wanted an alternative that combined a scripting 
language with an object-oriented aspect of programming. This being said Ruby is a dynamic, reflective object-oriented programming language which means that it uses objects (data structures), attributes and methods. 

### Usage

Ruby is most commonly used in conjunction with Rails which is known as Ruby on Rails. Ruby on Rails is a programming language developed for creating web applications. The three top most popular projects on github for Ruby, in order, are: 1. A guide to Ruby on Rails https://github.com/rails/rails 2. Blog-aware, static site generator https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll 3.A guide to Ruby https://github.com/ruby/ruby. 


### Resources 

For this semester I will mostly be using the information from https://www.ruby-lang.org and occasionally information from www.StackOverflow.com.
